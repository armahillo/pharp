- Mysql class needs to be improved
+-- better security
+-- more efficient 
+-- more tightly coupled with the AR class (fully integrated?)

- AR class needs to be optimized
+-- set_table shouldn't be necessary

- AR class needs additional methods
+-- static::all() needs to be completed
+-- __invoke should handle Rails-style "magic finders"
+-- __toString() should return a merge of the data + dirty_data arrays
